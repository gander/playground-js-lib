# playground

This package was created only to test creating a multi-system module, and adding new configurations, linters, tests, 
and publications on different registers. It does not contain code that you might find useful in your application, unless 
you are looking for an answer on how to create or configure such a package, then feel free to use my bugs and corrections.
